# bomberman
## Final project of Fundamentals of Machine Learning
Implementation of a agent able to play the bomberman game using reinforcement learning. Our main approach is Deep Q-Learning to handle the large feature space. However, this repository contains also the attempt to use Q-learning with a Regression Tree and a PCA dimension reduction to achive a reasonable size of the feature space. Further this repository also contains different DQN agents with different state representations as well as agents which are bulid to solve different challenges.

`trainingTestData` contains the data obtained while training our models. This was used for section 3 on "Experimental Results" in our report.

More information is given in our Report.

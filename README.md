# bomberman
## Final project of Fundamentals of Machine Learning
Implementation of a agent able to play the bomberman game using reinforcement learning. Our main approach is Deep Neural Q-Learning to handle the large feature space. However, this repository contains also the attempt to use Q-learning with a Regression Tree and a PCA dimension reduction to achive a reasonable size of the feature space. Further this repository also contains different DNQ agents with different state representations as well as agents which are bulid to solve different challenges.
More information is given in our Report.
